## Project Objective
- Provide a clear picture of inventory and sales in one place  
- Track customers, suppliers, products, and stock levels  
- Show what’s selling, what’s running low, and how the business is performing financially  

## KPIs
- Total Customers  
- Total Products  
- Total Suppliers  
- Purchase Amount  
- Sales Amount  
- Current Stock Value  
- Profit or Loss  
- Low-stock Alerts (items below threshold)  

## Overview – How This Works
- Sales and purchase transactions automatically feed data into the system  
- Dashboard updates in real time with customers, suppliers, products, stock value, and sales  
- Low-stock alerts trigger when quantity falls below threshold with supplier contact info for reordering  
- Top-selling products displayed in a pie chart to highlight major revenue drivers  
- Top customers displayed in a bar chart to identify high-value buyers  
- Available stock chart lists all products and remaining quantities to highlight overstocked and understocked items  

## Analysis
- Critical items such as HP Pavilion laptops, iPhones, and iPads flagged as below safe stock level  
- Best-selling products like Bluetooth speakers dominate the top sales chart  
- Customer analysis shows who is spending the most to identify the most valuable buyers  
- Stock chart highlights high-stock items (e.g., smartwatches) and low-stock items to guide purchasing decisions  

## Business Impact
- Prevent lost sales by warning before products run out  
- Highlight key customers and best-selling products to guide marketing and stock priorities  
- Make overstock and understock issues visible to improve cash flow and purchasing decisions  
- Enable faster decisions, more efficient operations, and increased profit potential
