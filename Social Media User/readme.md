The dashboard's goal is to analyze global social media user behavior and trends across 2015–2025, focusing on:
- Demographics (age groups, gender, verified accounts)
- Usage patterns and average daily screen time
- Primary usage categories (messaging, forums, professional networking, video sharing, etc.)
- Global reach and platform coverage

- **Average daily time spent:** `148.58 minutes` per user  
- **Verified accounts:** `51.14%` Yes / `48.86%` No  
- **Gender split:** ~`51%` Male / `49%` Female  
- **Right vs Wrong Screen Time:** `42%` Right / `58%` Wrong

## 🔑 Key Findings
1. **High unproductive/wrong screen time** (58%), indicating digital well-being and productivity concerns.  
2. **Young adults (20–29)** are the most active demographic segment.  
3. **Balanced gender representation** — nearly equal male/female participation.  
4. **Verified accounts are slightly more prevalent** — suggests platform authentication adoption.  
5. **Messaging leads usage**, but video and short-form content are rapidly significant.

## 🌍 Welfare & Implications
- **Digital well-being:** The large portion of wrong screen time suggests the need for awareness campaigns, tools for healthier usage, and product features (time limits, nudges).  
- **Business & Education:** The dominance of youth & video trends signals opportunities for digital learning, marketing, and short-form content monetization.  
- **Policy:** Regulators and platforms should work on content moderation, mental health support, and misinformation mitigation.  
- **Inclusion:** Even distribution across genders indicates social media is broadly accessible; targeted programs can extend reach to older demographics.
