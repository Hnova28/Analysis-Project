## ðŸ’¡ Business Impact
This dashboard isnâ€™t just about numbers â€“ itâ€™s about making better decisions in real life.  
Hereâ€™s how it helps the business:

- **Focus on what works best** â€“ It shows which products, customers, and regions bring the most profit, so the business knows where to invest more energy.  
- **Smarter pricing decisions** â€“ By comparing expensive vs budget products, itâ€™s clear which strategy brings in real money.  
- **Understand customers better** â€“ Age, gender, and buying habits give insights into who the real buyers are, helping create more targeted offers.  
- **Plan for the right time** â€“ Seeing that weekdays or certain months do better means promotions and campaigns can be timed to match customer behavior.  
- **Manage stock wisely** â€“ It highlights which products sell fast and which ones stay unsold, helping to avoid waste and plan inventory better.
